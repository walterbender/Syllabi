INFORMATION GRAPHICS
====================

Graphic design maintains a constant presence in our lives. It
connects, directs, informs, entices, and even entertains a captive
audience who often are unaware that the discipline of graphic design
exists. Its modes are many: from the unobtrusive utilitarian nature of
a digit on a phone, to the in-your-face call to action of an editorial
or campaign poster. Graphic design is a power tool. Graphic designers
skillfully utilize this tool to communicate, inspire and motivate.

Jon Craine

Objective
---------

This course will offer students an opportunity to practice the visual
problem-solving of graphic design, engaging them in discussions about
its value as an artistic and cultural endeavor, as well as its role in
organizing everyday life.

Approach
--------

Exercises and discussions will use the basic foundational elements of
typography, composition (layout), grid, and the understanding of
graphic design as practice for generating communication-based
solutions.

Course Organization
-------------------

There will be two weekly meetings: (1) a discussion and experiment;
and (2) a recitation for in-depth review of the material. Each time
this course is offered, the class will visit a local institution or
cultural site that will serve as the client for an inclusive graphic
design exploration. Exercises in this course will include: historical
and contemporary perspectives on graphic design, typographic studies,
logo and brand development, creating design systems, small and large
format layout construction, display, tour guide and way-finding.

Course Goals
------------

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Understand and apply basic elements and principles of graphic
  design, including: typography and letterform; space and layout(s);
  relationships between image, text and message; and identity and branding
  systems in graphic design;
* Understand graphic design as an artistic and cultural practice with
  direct implications on the functioning of everyday life;
* Use their acquired knowledge of the historical development of
