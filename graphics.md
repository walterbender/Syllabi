INFORMATION GRAPHICS
====================

Graphic design maintains a constant presence in our lives. It
connects, directs, informs, entices, and even entertains a captive
audience who often are unaware that the discipline of graphic design
exists. Its modes are many: from the unobtrusive utilitarian nature of
a digit on a phone, to the in-your-face call to action of an editorial
or campaign poster. Graphic design is a power tool. Graphic designers
skillfully utilize this tool to communicate, inspire and motivate.

Instructor

Jon Craine<br>
Design Faculty

Objective
---------

This course will offer students an opportunity to practice the visual
problem-solving of graphic design, engaging them in discussions about
its value as an artistic and cultural endeavor, as well as its role in
organizing everyday life.

Approach
--------

Exercises and discussions will use the basic foundational elements of
typography, composition (layout), grid, and the understanding of
graphic design as practice for generating communication-based
solutions.

Course Organization
-------------------

Each time this course is offered, the class will visit a local
institution or cultural site that will serve as the client for an
inclusive graphic design exploration.

The course is broken into two phases: liquid (innovation) and solid
(consolidation).

Throughout the both phases of the course, students will be working on
an project of their own choosing within the context of the "client"
site. The intent is to offer students the opportunity to pursue
something personally meaningful while still being responsive to a
real-world need.

During the *liquid* phase, Weeks 1 through 6, there will be two weekly
meetings: (1) a discussion and experiment; and (2) a recitation for
in-depth review of the material.  Exercises in this phase course will
include: historical and contemporary perspectives on graphic design,
typographic studies, logo and brand development, creating design
systems, small and large format layout construction, display, tour
guide and way-finding.

During the *solid* phase, Weeks 8 through 15, there will be
twice-weekly meetings with the design faculty to move through a design
pipeline, taking the ideas developed in the *liquid* phase into a
design recommendation for production and deployment at the "client"
site.

Course Goals
------------

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Understand and apply basic elements and principles of graphic
  design, including: typography and letterform; space and layout(s);
  relationships between image, text and message; and identity and branding
  systems in graphic design;
* Understand graphic design as an artistic and cultural practice with
  direct implications on the functioning of everyday life;
* Use their acquired knowledge of the historical development of
  graphic design and its emergence as a form of “high art” in the modern
  period to solve visual communication problems.

"Almost anybody can have an idea... Getting things actually done is
where people stumble." &mdash;Linus Torvalds

Goal

Problem definition, typically a synthesis of an interim output of the
liquid phase with a real-world problem.
