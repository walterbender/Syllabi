INTRODUCTION TO INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROCESS
=========================================

This course teaches tools and methods for industrial design and product development. It is the foundation upon which industrial-design students conceive, design, and prototype a physical product. These tools and methods directly apply to advanced design courses and will be expanded upon in the Design Studio courses and industrial-design electives.

Objective
---------

This course serves as an introduction to the industrial arts and
method design methology.

The course combines studies of and exercises in design methodology,
our process Industrial Arts and Method (IAM) uses the ‘water and ice’
metaphor to describe a full-immersion model of learning and doing. In
our model, water represents open-ended invention; Ice represents joint
directed-research of selected projects identify by the students, where
they will apply this process.

The items illustrated and practiced during the course are problem
identification and design possibilities, written report of the project
description, the creation and maintenance of a sketch log, and user
evaluation of the project solutions. The final product of the course
is a design solution for the identified problem, in most cases a
proposal for a product or system development.

Approach
--------

The course consists of active student research, the acquisition of
knowledge, lectures, group work, and individual project
work. Participants will define project details and development
schedule according to the specific project brief as presented at the
beginning of the course. All sections of the course are obligatory.

Students will select a series of simple daily objects to use as base
projects for the industrial design program. Examples include a chair,
a work table, a lamp, a backpack, etc. Designing these objects will
require knowledge of ergonomics, material costs, human factors,
manufacturing, etc.

Course Organization
-------------------

The course is broken into two phases: liquid (innovation) and solid
(consolidation).

Throughout the both phases of the course, students will be working on
a project of their own choosing. The intent is to offer students the
opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

During the *liquid* phase, Weeks 1 through 6, there will be two weekly
meetings: (1) a discussion and experiment; and (2) a recitation for
in-depth review of the material. Each week, different tools relevant
to color will be presented and a discussion will ensue.

During the *solid* phase, Weeks 8 through 15, there will be
twice-weekly meetings with the design faculty to move through a design
pipeline, taking the ideas developed in the *liquid* phase into a
design recommendation for production.

Requirements
------------

Weekly programming assignments and reading, as well as an individual
or group term project. Classes will consist of a weekly group
experiment, brief lecture, and discussion. There will be occasional
guest lectures by leading color researchers.

Course Outline
--------------

* Week 1 Introduction to Design Methodology: The IAM Process 

Liquid Phase
------------
* Week 2 Imagine and realize: create ideas and build prototypes.
* Week 3 Critique and reflect: engage with practitioners in an
  authentic critical dialogue about the work.
* Week 4 Iteration within the IAM process to push our ideas further.
* Week 5 Document and Select: Prepare documentation for problem
  definition in the Solid Phase.

Solid Phase
-----------
* Week 6 Problem definition, a synthesis of an interim output of the
  liquid phase with a real-world problem;
* Week 7 Consolidation: of the concepts through a process of sketches,
  layout, functional and material design, and cost analysis;
* Week 8 Technical feasibility and product relevance, which may result
  in our revisiting the problem definition;
* Week 9 Prototyping;
* Week 10 Selection of (three) candidate designs;
* Week 11 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (mechanical designs);
* Week 12 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (aesthetic models);
* Week 13 Making design recommendations to production;
* Week 14 Prepare final presentations;
* Week 15 Final Presentations

Grading
-------

* Attendance and class participation (15%)
* Liquid Phase (30%)
* Journal (15%)
* Solid Phase (project development and final presentation) (40%)
