INTRODUCTION TO INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROCESS
=========================================

Introduction to Industrial Design Process is the foundation course
through which Miami College of Design students learn to conceive,
design, and prototype a physical product. The course teaches the basic
tools and methods for industrial design and product development based
upon the Industrial Arts and Method (IAM) design methodology. This
methodology uses the ‘Water and Ice’ metaphor to describe a
full-immersion model of learning by doing. In our model, Water
represents open-ended invention; Ice represents joint-directed
research of selected projects identified by the students in which they
will apply this process.

The tools and methods developed in Introduction to Industrial Design
Process directly apply to the advanced design courses, and will be
expanded upon in the Design Studio courses and the industrial-design
electives.

Objective
---------

This course serves as the introduction to the Industrial Arts and
Method design methodology. Students taking this course will learn
about problem identification and design possibilities, written
documentation of the project description, creation and maintenance of
a sketch log, and user evaluation of the project solutions.

The final product of the course is a design solution for the
identified problem, in most cases a proposal for a product or system
development.


Approach
--------

Since the beginning of time humans have found a way to relax their
bodies, maybe initially reclining their back against a tree. Thinking
about seating surfaces will be our challenge throughout the semester
as we consider a wide range of situations and constraints.

Students will select a series of seating surfaces to use as base
projects for the industrial design program. They will work on a
project of their own choosing within the broad category of seating
surfaces, with the intent of offering the students the opportunity to
pursue an endeavor that is personally meaningful. The design of their
seating surface will require knowledge of ergonomics, material costs,
human factors, manufacturing, and more.

The course combines studies of, and exercises in, the IAM design
methodology. It consists of active student research and the
acquisition of knowledge through lectures, group work, and individual
project work. Participants will define project details and a
development schedule according to the specific project brief as
presented at the beginning of the course.


Course Organization
-------------------

The course meets twice weekly and is broken into two phases: “Water”,
or Liquid innovation, and “Ice”, or solid consolidation. During the
Liquid phase, Weeks 1 through 6, different tools relevant to the
design projects will be presented, explored, and a discussion will
ensue. Students will engage in an iterative cycle of expansive
imagination and creation, in alternation with authentic critical
dialogue promoting the exchange of improvements and alternative
solutions.

During the Solid phase, Weeks 8 through 15, the design faculty will
assist the students at they move their project through a design
pipeline, taking the ideas developed in the Liquid phase into a design
recommendation for production.

Each student will maintain his/her individual sketch log through which
they will reflect and register their learning and creations. This log
will become a recipe for the student’s idea development process and an
essential instrument to final documentation of an industrial design
patent.

Liquid Phase
------------

<a name="WEEK1">
1. INTRODUCTION TO DESIGN METHODOLOGY: THE IAM PROCESS
------------------------------------------------------
</a>

Students will begin by creating a log summary of one of the items in
their portfolio that they submitted for admission to MCOD, and capture
in one page the most relevant aspects of their design.  The summaries
will be socialized in the class and a discussion will ensue about the
role of sketch logs within the broader IAM design process.  This
exercise will be followed by a presentation of a product that
encompasses and exemplifies all the the steps in the IAM process
design methodology.

<a name="WEEK2">
2. IMAGINE AND REALIZE
----------------------
</a>

Students will generate ideas and build prototypes.

Since the beginning of time humans have found a way to relax their
bodies, maybe initially reclining their back against a tree. What
would be, in our time, and in your personal experience, the best
solution for a comfortable, relaxing and safe way to rest your body?
Can you use this solution in all situations? What criteria are you
going to consider in your design? Thinking about seating surfaces will
be our challenge.

In the first class this week, there will be a conceptualization phase
of possible seating surfaces. In the second class, teams will present
their concepts and there will be a discussion of the process of idea
creation.

<a name="WEEK3">
3. CRITIQUE AND REFLECT
-----------------------
</a>
	
Students will engage with practitioners in an authentic critical
dialogue about the work.

Continuing with the discussion of seating surfaces, there will be a
presentation of a real life example (proposal for a mobile office),
demonstrating how the critique received from the client modified the
entire design.

Students will re-visit their proposals for seating surfaces using
specific constraints identified by the group. By the end of the week,
there will be a convergence around one or two possible solutions that
will be used to properly define the product definition.

<a name="WEEK4">
4. ITERATION
------------
</a>

Students will iterate within the IAM process to push their ideas
further.

Students will revisit their own ideas and, with the input of an
external expert, they will continue to define a more accurate solution
based on their critiques by considering factors such as cost, form,
materials, and functionality. Students will add all the different
constraints related to the product in order to generate a more
accurate problem definition to develop in the Solid phase.

This will be achieved using large group brainstorming techniques, and
then breaking out into smaller groups to generate more definite ideas
in 2D and 3D representations.

<a name="WEEK5">
5. DOCUMENT AND SELECT
----------------------
</a>

Students will prepare documentation for problem definition in the
Solid Phase.

In the first session of the week, students in groups of 2 to 3 members
will collect and prepare all the information that has been generated
individually and in the groups in order to define their own personal
sketch log which will be the basis for their individual projects in
the solid phase of the course. The sketch log may be created in any
one of a number of formats that can be presented to the class (slides,
graphics, renderings, models, etc). In the second session, students
will present their individual sketch logs to the class.

Solid Phase
-----------

During this phase of the course, each week the teams will refine their
designs for seating surfaces according to the sequence of steps in the
design process. Students will work individually through each step in
the process. In addition, each week students will collect, reflect
upon, and analyze their process with the rest of the group.

<a name="WEEK6">
6. PROBLEM DEFINITION
---------------------
</a>

Students will create a synthesis of an interim output of the liquid
phase with a real-world problem.

For the first session, students will work in groups to prepare their
own product definition for their selected challenge of seating
surface. They will work as a group defining details and constraints
for the general subject of seating surfaces (i.e. current market
trends and solutions, distinct materials, R&D, etc).

In the second session, they will finalize and define their problem
with a project brief which will include: design criteria, constraints,
market analysis, technical details such as weight and cost off their
seating surface product. It will also include a program schedule of
project deliverables and deadlines.

<a name="WEEK7">
7. CONSOLIDATION
----------------
</a>

Students will consolidate their concepts through a process of
sketches, layout, functional and material design, and cost analysis.
For the first session, teams will engage in a brainstorming session to
define a preliminary configuration of proposed solutions to the
challenge. This will also include: open parameters for their designs
such as risk analysis, structure, materials and preliminary
manufacturing considerations.  In the second session, they will
develop a more detailed and refined solution that will be discussed as
a group to prepare for the consolidation phase.

<a name="WEEK8">
8. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY AND PRODUCT RELEVANCE
----------------------------------------------
</a>

In the first session, groups peer-review the class’ work, selecting
the best 2 or 3 proposals from each team and begin early steps of
prototyping.

In the second session, groups will re-evaluate the early prototypes
and select the best option for the teams to continue preparing their
newer prototypes. It may be possible that a team’s design needs to be
re-made, setting the process back to week 6.

<a name="WEEK9">
9. PROTOTYPING
--------------
</a>

During both sessions, teams will engage in various modeling and
prototyping techniques of their choosing including, but not limited
to, constructing, 3D printing, wood-working, paper mache, among
others. The goal for this week is to have a functional prototype(s) to
present for Week 10. If certain students are stuck in redesigning
their ideas Week 9 can be used as a ‘buffer’ week.

<a name="WEEK10">
10. SELECTION OF TWO CANDIDATE DESIGNS
--------------------------------------
</a>

During both sessions, teams will have the opportunity to present to a
panel composed of faculty, field experts and peers. Students are
expected to present their sketch log books, and have a formal
presentation prepared showing initial research, concept art, product
analysis, and a working prototype.

<a name="WEEK11">
11. FINALIZATION OF A DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING (MECHANICAL DESIGNS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will engage in finalizing their working
design, documenting technical aspects of the project such as:

Dimensions, tech drawings, CAD files, assembly instructions, market
cost BOM.  Multi-view orthographic layouts, with defined ID for all
components Refined product graphics and product name placement

Graphics as required for the development of a consistent interface and
interaction with the product line CMF document (Color, Materials and
Finishes/Texture specifications)

<a name="WEEK12">
12. FINALIZATION OF A DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING (AESTHETIC MODELS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will finalize their working design,
perfecting and polishing their product to make it aesthetically
pleasing and professional.  The aesthetic models developed will also
address design language opportunities, function, user interface,
materials and human factors.

<a name="WEEK13">
13. MAKING DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------
</a>

In the first session, groups peer-review the class’ work, helping
their peers to polish their projects before their final
presentations. The professor will also provide professional feedback
on their solutions and suggest any last-minute recommendations prior
to the final presentation.

<a name="WEEK14">
14. PREPARE FINAL PRESENTATION
------------------------------
</a>

Students are not required to attend this session and will instead use
this time to rehearse and polish their presentations on their own
time.

<a name="WEEK15">
15. FINAL PRESENTATION
----------------------
</a>

During both sessions, teams will have the opportunity to present to a
panel composed of faculty, field experts and peers. Students are
expected to present their sketch log books, and have a formal
presentation prepared showing initial research, concept art, product
analysis, and a working prototype.
