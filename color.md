Color For Designers
===================

This course covers the technical aspects of color for use in practical applications of design. Color is discussed from three distinct points of view: human vision, visual processing, and digital displays. Topics include the production of color, physiology and psychophysiology of color, the sensation of color, color systems, coding and processing, color vision, rendering in graphics environments, color as an interface, semantics and aesthetics of color.

INSTRUCTOR
----------

Walter Bender (walter@miamicollegeofdesign.com)

OBJECTIVE
---------

This course encourages students to experientially explore the relationships between sensory stimulus, color appearance, and the relationships of color appearance as a means to develop more effective color communication tools.

APPROACH
--------

To aid students in their pursuit, the course consists of hands on exploration of questions that point to the critical scientific and technological challenges of color and hands on attempt to pursue personal exploration of a model for color communication.

COURSE ORGANIZATION
-------------------

Generally each class will begin with discussion of research other people have done on the same topic as last week's exploration topic. This discussion may include visits by some of the researchers or by authors who have written on the subject. The intent is to encourage students to explore a subject before reading about it. This approach tends to avoid biasing interpretations of what might be going on and provides students with their own base of experience to which they can relate when reading research on the topic of interest. The second class activity will be an exploration of this week's class goal.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Weekly programming assignments and reading, as well as an individual or group term project. Classes will consist of a weekly group experiment, brief lecture, and discussion. There will be occasional guest lectures by leading color researchers.

COURSE OUTLINE
--------------

1. [Radiation and Appearance](#RADIATION)
2. [Color Science](#COLORSCIENCE) (color matching and colorimetry)
3. [The Mind's Eye](#MINDEYE) (visual pathways)
4. [Robust Communication](#ORDERSYSTEMS) (color-order systems)
5. [Deliberate Expression](#EXPRESSION) (color and affect)
6. [Project reviews](#PROJECTS)

GRADING
-------
50% of your grade is based on class participation in the experiential exploration of questions pointing to critical challenges.

25% of your grade will be for a project that might add insight to an effective color model with stated objectives. The intent is to offer you the opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

25% of your grade is dependent upon weekly problems.

<a name="RADIATION">
1. RADIATION AND APPEARANCE
</a>

Color is colors, plural. &mdash;Josef Albers

The engineer's or scientist's quantitative understanding of color is far removed from an artist's qualitative understanding of color. The former considers color as  something that is specified or measured in terms of metrics such as nanometers or just-noticeable-differences and speaks of color in terms of detection, discrimination, legibility, and contrast. However, for the artist or the poet, color is something to experience, not measure and quantify. Our current understanding of human color vision emanates from the traditions of both artists and scientists. Newton characterized light; Goethe contemplated its appearance.

Goal

Explore the relationship between radiation and appearance.
Experiment

Characterize the appearance of and measure the intensity of the surface radiation of white, gray, and black targets both under room light and sun light. (Be sure to make note of angle of the illuminant source and the viewing angle. Are there specular components?) What do your results tell you about the relationship between radiation and appearance?
Equipment

light meter, black, gray, white, and color surfaces
Questions to Consider

What ways can one describe the stimulation captured by the visual sensors?
What can isolated stimulation describe and not describe?
What can stimulation relationships describe and not describe?
What criteria would a model need to include in its definition to account for appearance?
Is appearance an object attribute?
How can one determine if people see the same appearance for the same sensory input?
Does ``white'' only apply to surfaces?
Are the conditions that establish white the same for establishing black?
What guidance is available for conditions in which the sensory stimulus can not be reproduced?
Homework

We theorized that we could predict that relative perceived value could be calculated as follows:
value = (surface reflection / ambient light),

and that contrast could be calculated as follows:

contrast = (light - dark) / (ambient light).

Part 1: Using Java, create a 400x400-pixel applet. You can only use black and white (no Java gray). Create a graphical object that appears gray. The interface should be simple, click once and the object should appear light, click again and the object should appear dark. You can do this through any means except changing the color of the object itself. Try to be creative. The conditions you implement could involve size, texture, motion, etc... It is more important to experiment than to present a foolproof solution.

Part 2: Given that these theories are true, what would you speculate about noise sensitivity as a function of lighting conditions?

Part 3: A television with the power off appears to be a greenish-gray color . Explaination how you perceive black on television when the set is turned on?
