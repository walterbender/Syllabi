COLOR FOR DESIGNERS
===================

This course covers the technical aspects of color for use in practical
applications of design. Color is discussed from three distinct points
of view: human vision, visual processing, and digital displays. Topics
include the production of color, physiology and psychophysiology of
color, the sensation of color, color systems, coding and processing,
color vision, rendering in graphics environments, color as an
interface, semantics and aesthetics of color.

Instructor
----------

Walter Bender (walter@miamicollegeofdesign.com)

Objective
---------

This course encourages students to experientially explore the
relationships between sensory stimulus, color appearance, and the
relationships of color appearance as a means to develop more effective
color communication tools.

Approach
--------

To aid students in their pursuit, the course consists of hands on
exploration of questions that point to the critical scientific and
technological challenges of color and hands on attempt to pursue
personal exploration of a model for color communication.

Course Organization
-------------------

Generally each class will begin with discussion of research other
people have done on the same topic as last week's exploration
topic. This discussion may include visits by some of the researchers
or by authors who have written on the subject. The intent is to
encourage students to explore a subject before reading about it. This
approach tends to avoid biasing interpretations of what might be going
on and provides students with their own base of experience to which
they can relate when reading research on the topic of interest. The
second class activity will be an exploration of this week's class
goal.

Requirements
------------

Weekly programming assignments and reading, as well as an individual
or group term project. Classes will consist of a weekly group
experiment, brief lecture, and discussion. There will be occasional
guest lectures by leading color researchers.

Course Outline
--------------

1. [Radiation and Appearance](#RADIATION)

<a name="RADIATION">
1. RADIATION AND APPEARANCE
---------------------------
</a>

*Color is colors, plural.* &mdash;Josef Albers

The engineer's or scientist's quantitative understanding of color is
far removed from an artist's qualitative understanding of color. The
former considers color as something that is specified or measured in
terms of metrics such as nanometers or just-noticeable-differences and
speaks of color in terms of detection, discrimination, legibility, and
contrast. However, for the artist or the poet, color is something to
experience, not measure and quantify. Our current understanding of
human color vision emanates from the traditions of both artists and
scientists. Newton characterized light; Goethe contemplated its
appearance.

Goal
----
Explore the relationship between radiation and appearance.

Experiment 1
------------
Characterize the appearance of and measure the intensity of the
surface radiation of white, gray, and black targets both under room
light and sun light. (Be sure to make note of angle of the illuminant
source and the viewing angle. Are there specular components?) What do
your results tell you about the relationship between radiation and
appearance?

Equipment
---------
light meter, black, gray, white, and color surfaces

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* What ways can one describe the stimulation captured by the visual sensors?
* What can isolated stimulation describe and not describe?
* What can stimulation relationships describe and not describe?
* What criteria would a model need to include in its definition to
  account for appearance?
* Is appearance an object attribute?
* How can one determine if people see the same appearance for the same
  sensory input?
* Does *white* only apply to surfaces?
* Are the conditions that establish white the same for establishing black?
* What guidance is available for conditions in which the sensory
  stimulus can not be reproduced?

Experiment 2
------------
Characterize the appearance of and measure the chromaticity of a
two-chamber room where one chamber is illuminated with red light and
the other chamber is illumminated with green light. What do your
results tell you about the relationship between spectral color and
appearance?

Equipment
---------
colorimeter, two-chamber box with a hole between the two chambers and
independent light source for each chamber

Questions to Consider
---------------------
* Does the sensation of color change over time?
* Is it possible to look at the same stimulous with each eye and
  perceive it differently?
* Can you come up with a model to explain how appearance might change
  due to context?

2. COLOR SCIENCE
----------------
</a>

*There was gold paint, but Rembrandt didn't use it to paint a golden
 helmet.* &mdash;Wittgenstein

Historically, color has been characterized by consideration of its
application. Considerations have included the physics of color, the
mechanisms of the human visual system (HVS), application to coding and
reproduction, and application to design and interactivity. Color has
been modeled as a physical, psychophysical, psychological, and
metaphysical phenomenon. Through both clinical and neurophysiological
studies, models of the HVS response to color have been developed,
beginning with the detection of radiation in the retina and continuing
as far as the visual cortex.

The discussion of color science is organized as a hierarchy. At the
bottom level is the detection of points of electromagnetic
radiation. At the next level is the appearance of radiation as an
ensemble of points. At the top level are the inferences made from
appearance. These inferences are the building blocks of color
communication.

Experiment
----------

Using multiple spectral sources, determine how many basis colors are
needed to match a stimulous.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* What are the challenges to color reproduction?  
* What happens when the print (yellow paper) and the display (blue
  LED) have to coexist?
* How does the lack of consideration of context limit the utility of
  color models such as Pantone, Munsell, and NCS?

*Color, when once reduced to certain definite rules, can be taught
 like music.* &mdash;G. Seurat

Although it is possible that one viewer's perception of color may be
very different from another's, experimental evidence suggests that the
relationships between colors are, in many respects, universal, and
thus relatively free from individual and cultural influences. The
"experience of color" can be described objectively, so that
predictable visual sensations can be elicited by adjusting the
relationships among colors. A model of color experience is described
that is based on the types of interactions among colors. The model
adjusts formal compositional attributes such as hue, value, chroma,
and their contrasts, as well as size and proportion. Components such
as these can be utilized to build a general architecture for adding
guidance to interactive systems.

Experiment
----------

Use hue, chroma, and value contrast, along with shape, position, and
size to grade quantitave, nominal, and ordinal data.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* How does color contribute to communication?
* How is the visual message-processing system impaired by the
  inability to see color?
* How is the ability to communicate visually affected both
  quantitatively and qualitatively?

5. DELIBERATE EXPRESSION
------------------------
</a>

*Color demands a response.* &mdash;N. Jacobson

For those of us with normal color vision, the vocabulary of color
communication is something both innate and intuitive. We do not rely
on prescriptions of color semantics or rules of color harmony to
determine a response to color. Our response to gravity and our sense
of balance are based on an internal "plumbline," not Newton's
equations. Similarly, our response to visual sensations and our sense
of dynamics and stress are inherent. It is this internal "color
plumbline".

The word "expression" is used to describe the human response to an
ensemble of color appearances. We have an internal psychophysical
response that is initiated when viewing multiple external
radiations. Although it is possible for one viewer's perception of
color to be very different from another's, experimental evidence
suggests that the relationships among internally generated colors are,
in many respects, universal, and thus relatively free from individual
and cultural influences. Examples of qualitative models of expression
are Jacobson's Relative Harmony Quotient and Kobayashi's Scale of
Colors. Examples of quantitative models are Moon and Spencer's
Geometric Formulation of Harmony and Sivik and Hård's Semantic
Dimensions.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* What are the factors that determine color experience?
* To what extent is it possible to "grade" color experience?
* How do cultural and personal preference impact color experience?
