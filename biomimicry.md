BIODESIGN: INNOVATION INSPIRED BY NATURE
========================================

Biodesign is the discipline of the study of best design ideas from the
natural world and how to imitate and utilize those designs to solve
human problems. The core idea of biodesign is that nature,
“imaginative” by necessity, has already solved many of the problems we
are grappling with. Animals, plants, and microbes are the consummate
engineers; they have found what works, what is appropriate, and most
importantly, what is sustainable.

Objective
---------

This course will explore past, present, and future examples of
biodesign solutions to human problems. We will learn how experts in
the field of biodesign use organisms and ecosystems from nature as
models, and how these models are used to discover engineering,
architectural, business management and operations, and
product-development solutions.

Students will develop a clear understanding of biodesign and how it
may be used to find sustainable solutions to human problems;
strengthen observation skills through “deep pattern recognition”; hone
essential communication skills—verbal, written, visual, and
scientific—through individual and team exercises; develop
critical-thinking and problem-solving skills; and foster engagement in
scientific discourse with audiences from non-scientific disciplines
through real-world experiences.

Approach
--------

Students will be introduced to the interdisciplinary technique of
biodesign and be provided with real-world experiences applying this
technique through individual and team work. The course focuses on the
design of hand tools as a lens into our exploration of design
solutions in nature. Students will work on a project of their own
choosing within the category of hand tools, perhaps a screwdriver, a
hammer, a saw, or some other tool invention.

By the end of the course, students will:
* have a solid understanding of biodesign;
* be able to explain what biodesign is to a variety of audiences in a
  clear and concise manner;
* be able to effectively apply the tool of biodesign to arrive at
  sustainable design solutions.

Course Organization
-------------------

Throughout the course, students will work on a small hand tool, e.g.,
a screwdriver, hammer, or hand saw.

Students will progress through the course through two phases: liquid
(innovation) and solid (consolidation).

During the liquid phase, Weeks 1 through 6, the bi-weekly meetings
will be organized in a dynamic interchange between experimentation,
discussion and presentation of the conceptual framework through the
exploration of concrete cases and examples.

During the solid phase, Weeks 8 through 15, there will be twice-weekly
meetings with the design faculty to move through a design pipeline,
taking the ideas developed in the liquid phase into a design
recommendation for production.

<a name="WEEK1">
1. INTRODUCTION TO BIODESIGN METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
</a>

In Week 1, students will be presented an overview of biodesign and they
will engage in a class discussion of how to derive design input from
nature. They will be presented with the design challenge for the
course, which is to develop a bionics solution for a hand tool. Students will
work in groups to explore the breadth of the assigned topic, creating
a product, idea, or concept. During these initial sessions, students
will aim to identify and select examples of nature, brainstorm ideas,
and generate initial concepts from them.
 
<a name="WEEK2">
2. IDENTIFICATION STEP
----------------------
</a>

Student will identify the functions that their designs will need to
perform. Students will translate the functions from their initial
concepts into an analog from the biological world. Students will
conduct field research from the topic selected (e.g., a hammer is
analogous to a woodpecker beak; a saw is analogous to praying mantis
claws). Students are encouraged to engage in brainstorming sessions
with their peers.

<a name="WEEK3">
3. IMPLEMENTATION STEP
----------------------
</a>

Students will translate those functions identified in Week 2 into
words or terms that make sense to the industrial designer. During these
sessions, students will generate a set of design solutions ranging
from radical to traditional; develop specific concepts and narrow
their selections to two concept designs.

<a name="WEEK4">
4. DISCOVERY STEP
-----------------
</a>

In the Discovery Step, students identify strategies used by nature
to accomplish those functions identified in Week 3. Students will
develop the strategies they have discovered into ideas to specify
design criteria and emulate those strategies in a design solution.

Students will revisit their own ideas, and with the input of external
experts (including a biologist and a mechanical engineer) they will
continue to define a more accurate solution based on their critiques
(e.g., cost, form, materials, functionality, etc.). They will add all
of these different constraints related to the product in order to
generate a more accurate problem definition to develop in the Solid
Phase. This will be achieved using group brainstorming sessions.

<a name="WEEK5">
5. ABSTRACT STEP
----------------
</a>

Students will translate the strategies they have discovered from
nature into ideas to specify design criterias and emulate those
strategies in a design solution.

Students have the option of working individually or in teams of two to
three members. Students will collect and prepare all the information
that has been generated individually and in the groups in order to
define their own personal sketch log, which will be the basis for
their projects in the Solid Phase of the course. The sketch log may be
created in any one of a number of formats that can be presented to the
class (slides, graphics, renderings, models, etc.).

Solid Phase
-----------

During this phase of the course students will work on refining the
design of their hand tool. Students will work individually through
each step in the design process and collect, reflect upon, and analyze
their process in small groups.

<a name="WEEK6">
6. PROBLEM DEFINITION
---------------------
</a>

Students will make a synthesis of an interim output of the Liquid
Phase with a real-world problem; For the first session, students will
work in groups to prepare their own product definition for their
selected hand tool. They will work as a group defining details and
constraints for their specific challenge (i.e. current market trends
and solutions, different materials, R&D, etc). In the second session,
they will finalize and define their problem with a project brief which
will include: design criteria, constraints, market analysis, technical
details such as weight and cost of their product. It will also include
a program schedule of project deliverables and deadlines.

<a name="WEEK7">
7. CONSOLIDATION
----------------
</a>

Students will consolidate their concepts through a process of
sketches, layout, functional and material design, and cost analysis.
For the first session, students will engage in a brainstorming session
to define a preliminary configuration of proposed solutions to the
challenge. This will also include: open parameters for their designs
such as risk analysis, structure, materials, and preliminary
manufacturing considerations. In the second session, they will
develop a more detailed and refined solution that will be discussed as
a group to prepare for the technical-feasibility phase.

<a name="WEEK8">
8. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
------------------------
</a>

Students will investigate technical feasibility and product relevance,
which may result in our revisiting the problem definition. In the
first session, groups peer-review the class’ work, selecting the best
two or three proposals from each team and begin early steps of
prototyping.  In the second session, groups will re-evaluate the early
prototypes and select the best option for the students to continue
preparing their newer prototypes. It may be possible that a team’s
design needs to be re-made, setting the process back to Week 6.

<a name="WEEK9">
9. PROTOTYPING
--------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will engage in various modeling and
prototyping techniques of their choosing, including, but not limited
to, constructing, 3D printing, wood-working, paper mache, etc. The
goal for this week is to have a functional prototype(s) to present for
Week 10. If students are stuck in redesigning their ideas, then Week 9
can be used as a buffer week.

<a name="WEEK10">
10. SELECTION OF THE CANDIDATE DESIGNS
--------------------------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will have the opportunity to present to
a panel composed of faculty, field experts, and peers. Students are
expected to present their sketch log books, and have a formal
presentation prepared showing initial research, concept art, product
analysis, and a working prototype.

<a name="WEEK11">
11. MECHANICAL DESIGNS
----------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will engage in finalizing their working
design, documenting technical aspects of the project such as:
* dimensions,
* tech drawings,
* CAD files,
* assembly instructions,
* market cost,
* bill of materials (BOM), and
* multi-view orthographic layouts.

Industrial Design will be defined for all components: refined product
graphics and product-name placement as required for the development of
a consistent interface and interaction with the product line color,
materials and finishes/texture (CMF) document specifications.

<a name="WEEK12">
12. AESTHETIC MODELS
--------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will finalize their working
design, perfecting and polishing their product to make it
aesthetically pleasing and professional. The aesthetic models
developed will also address design language opportunities, function,
user interface, materials and human factors.

<a name="WEEK13">
13. MAKING DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------
</a>

Student groups will engage in peer-review of their class work, helping
students polish their projects before their final presentations. The
faculty member will also provide professional feedback on their
solutions and suggest any last-minute recommendations prior to the
final presentation.

<a name="WEEK14">
14. PREPARE FINAL PRESENTATIONS
-------------------------------
</a>

Students will use this time to rehearse and polish their
presentations.

<a name="WEEK15">
15. FINAL PRESENTATIONS
-----------------------
</a>

During both sessions, students will have the opportunity to present to
a panel composed of faculty, field experts and peers. Students are
expected to present their sketch log books, and have a formal
presentation prepared showing initial research, concept art, product
analysis, and a working prototype.
