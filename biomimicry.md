BIODESIGN: INNOVATION INSPIRED BY NATURE
========================================

Biodesign is a new discipline that studies nature’s best ideas and
then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems. The
core idea of biodesign is that nature, imaginative by necessity, has
already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals,
plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers; they have found
what works, what is appropriate, and most importantly, what is
sustainable.

Objective
---------

This class will explore past, present, and future examples of
biodesign solutions to human problems. We will learn how experts in
the field of biodesign use organisms and ecosystems of nature as
models and how these models are used in to discover engineering,
architectural, business operations/management, and product-development
solutions.

Requirements
------------


Course Outline
--------------

* Week 1 Introduction to Design Methodology: The IAM Process 

Liquid Phase
------------
* Week 2 Imagine and realize: create ideas and build prototypes.
* Week 3 Critique and reflect: engage with practitioners in an
  authentic critical dialogue about the work.
* Week 4 Iteration within the IAM process to push our ideas further.
* Week 5 Document and Select: Prepare documentation for problem
  definition in the Solid Phase.

Solid Phase
-----------
* Week 6 Problem definition, a synthesis of an interim output of the
  liquid phase with a real-world problem;
* Week 7 Consolidation: of the concepts through a process of sketches,
  layout, functional and material design, and cost analysis;
* Week 8 Technical feasibility and product relevance, which may result
  in our revisiting the problem definition;
* Week 9 Prototyping;
* Week 10 Selection of (three) candidate designs;
* Week 11 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (mechanical designs);
* Week 12 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (aesthetic models);
* Week 13 Making design recommendations to production;
* Week 14 Prepare final presentations;
* Week 15 Final Presentations

Grading
-------

* Attendance and class participation (15%)
* Liquid Phase (30%)
* Journal (15%)
* Solid Phase (project development and final presentation) (40%)
