BIODESIGN: INNOVATION INSPIRED BY NATURE
========================================

Biodesign is a new discipline that studies nature’s best ideas and
then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems. The
core idea of biodesign is that nature, imaginative by necessity, has
already solved many of the problems we are grappling with. Animals,
plants, and microbes are the consummate engineers; they have found
what works, what is appropriate, and most importantly, what is
sustainable.

Objective
---------

This class will explore past, present, and future examples of
biodesign solutions to human problems. We will learn how experts in
the field of biodesign use organisms and ecosystems of nature as
models and how these models are used to discover engineering,
architectural, business operations/management, and product-development
solutions.

Students will develop a clear understanding of biodesign and how it
may be used to find sustainable solutions to human problems;
strengthen observation skills through “deep pattern recognition”; hone
essential communication skills—verbal, written, visual, and
scientific—through individual and team exercises; develop
critical-thinking and problem-solving skills; and foster engagement in
scientific discourse with audiences from non-scientific disciplines
through real-world experiences.

Approach
--------

Students will be introduced to the interdisciplinary tool of biodesign
and provide real-world experiences applying this tool through
individual and team work.

By the end of the course, students will: 
* have a solid understanding of biodesign; 
* be able to explain what biodesign is to a variety of audiences in a
  clear and concise manner;
* be able to effectively apply the tool of biodesign to arrive at
  sustainable design solutions.

Course Organization
-------------------

The course is broken into two phases: liquid (innovation) and solid
(consolidation).

Throughout the both phases of the course, students will be working on
a project of their own choosing. The intent is to offer students the
opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

During the *liquid* phase, Weeks 1 through 6, there will be two weekly
meetings: (1) a discussion and experiment; and (2) a recitation for
in-depth review of the material.

During the *solid* phase, Weeks 8 through 15, there will be
twice-weekly meetings with the design faculty to move through a design
pipeline, taking the ideas developed in the *liquid* phase into a
design recommendation for production.

Requirements
------------


Course Outline
--------------

* Week 1 Introduction to Design Methodology: The IAM Process 

Liquid Phase
------------
* Week 2 Imagine and realize: create ideas and build prototypes.
* Week 3 Critique and reflect: engage with practitioners in an
  authentic critical dialogue about the work.
* Week 4 Iteration within the IAM process to push our ideas further.
* Week 5 Document and Select: Prepare documentation for problem
  definition in the Solid Phase.

Solid Phase
-----------
* Week 6 Problem definition, a synthesis of an interim output of the
  liquid phase with a real-world problem;
* Week 7 Consolidation: of the concepts through a process of sketches,
  layout, functional and material design, and cost analysis;
* Week 8 Technical feasibility and product relevance, which may result
  in our revisiting the problem definition;
* Week 9 Prototyping;
* Week 10 Selection of (three) candidate designs;
* Week 11 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (mechanical designs);
* Week 12 Finalization of a design for manufacturing (aesthetic models);
* Week 13 Making design recommendations to production;
* Week 14 Prepare final presentations;
* Week 15 Final Presentations

Grading
-------

* Attendance and class participation (15%)
* Liquid Phase (30%)
* Journal (15%)
* Solid Phase (project development and final presentation) (40%)
