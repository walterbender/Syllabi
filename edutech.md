1. CONSTRUCTIONISM

“Where the computer's true power as an educational medium
lies&mdash;is in the ability to facilitate and extend children's
awesome natural ability and drive to construct, hypothesize, explore,
experiment, evaluate, draw conclusions&mdash;in short to
learn&mdash;all by themselves. It is this very drive...that is
squelched by our current educational system.” &mdash;Seymour Papert
