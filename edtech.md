LEARNING-CENTRIC DESIGN
=======================

Instructor
----------

Walter Bender (walter@miamicollegeofdesign.com)<br>
Ann Valente (ann@miamicollegeofdesign.com)

Objective
---------

The objective of this course is to introduce Constructionist Learning
and the principles of "learning-centric" design to students.

Approach
--------

The approach we take is to immerse the student into an authentic
problem-solving scenario in which they apply the principles of
Constructionist Learning to their own pursuits. Students learn about
Constructionist Learning by engaging in Constructionist Learning.

Course Organization
-------------------

Throughout the course, students will be working on an
educational-technology project of their own choosing. Each week,
different tools from the Constructionist toolkit will be presented. A
discussion will ensue.

Course Outline
--------------

1. [Constructionism](#CONSTRUCTIONISM)
2. [Logo](#LOGO)
3. [Logo Robotics](#ROBOTICS)
4. [The Sugar Desktop](#SUGAR)
5. [Human Subjects](#COUHES)
6. [Project reviews](#PROJECTS)

Grading
-------
50% of your grade is based on class participation in the experiential
exploration of questions pointing to critical challenges.

50% of your grade will be for a project that might add insight to an
effective color model with stated objectives. The intent is to offer
you the opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

<a name="CONSTRUCTIONISM">
1. CONSTRUCTIONISM
------------------
</a>

“Where the computer's true power as an educational medium lies is in
the ability to facilitate and extend children's awesome natural
ability and drive to construct, hypothesize, explore, experiment,
evaluate, draw conclusions&mdash;in short to learn&mdash;all by
themselves. It is this very drive...that is squelched by our current
educational system.” &mdash;Seymour Papert

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to impart upon the students the underlying
tenets of Constructionist Learning. Rather than instructing, telling,
or showing the students what Constructionism is, students will break
into small groups and teach each other some indivudual skill.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* Is "show, don't tell" different from traditional instruction?
* When engaging in your teaching experience, in what ways were your
  students contructing, hypothesizing, exploting, experimenting,
  evaluating, and drawing conclusions?
* How did you ensure that the students were learning?

2. LOGO: A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR CHILDREN
--------------------------------------------
</a>

Goal
----

Logo is a programming language...

<a name="ROBOTICS">
3. LOGO ROBOTICS
----------------
</a>

Logo enables children to “use computers to manipulate things more
familiar than the then-prevalent numbers and equations.”

Questions to Consider
---------------------
* How do Contructionist principles manifest themselves in your project?
* How can you characterize the learning in your project?
* How can you measure the learning in your project?
* To what extent is your project an incremental change vs a disruption?
* How will your project mesh with existing educational initiatives?
* How does your project create value?
