LEARNING-CENTRIC DESIGN
=======================

Instructor
----------

Walter Bender (walter@miamicollegeofdesign.com)<br>
Ann Valente (ann@miamicollegeofdesign.com)

Objective
---------

The objective of this course is to introduce Constructionist Learning
and the principles of "learning-centric" design to students.

Approach
--------

The approach we take is to immerse the student into an authentic
problem-solving scenario in which they apply the principles of
Constructionist Learning to their own pursuits. Students learn about
Constructionist Learning by engaging in Constructionist Learning.

Course Organization
-------------------

Throughout the course, students will be working on an
educational-technology project of their own choosing. Each week,
different tools from the Constructionist toolkit will be presented. A
discussion will ensue.

Course Outline
--------------

1. [Constructionism](#CONSTRUCTIONISM)
2. [Logo](#LOGO)
3. [Logo Robotics](#ROBOTICS)
4. [The Sugar Desktop](#SUGAR)
5. [Human Subjects](#COUHES)
6. [Project reviews](#PROJECTS)

Grading
-------
50% of your grade is based on class participation in the experiential
exploration of questions pointing to critical challenges.

50% of your grade will be for a project that might add insight to an
effective color model with stated objectives. The intent is to offer
you the opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

<a name="CONSTRUCTIONISM">
1. CONSTRUCTIONISM
------------------
</a>

“Where the computer's true power as an educational medium lies is in
the ability to facilitate and extend children's awesome natural
ability and drive to construct, hypothesize, explore, experiment,
evaluate, draw conclusions&mdash;in short to learn&mdash;all by
themselves. It is this very drive...that is squelched by our current
educational system.” &mdash;Seymour Papert

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to impart upon the students the underlying
tenets of Constructionist Learning. Rather than instructing, telling,
or showing the students what Constructionism is, students will break
into small groups and teach each other some indivudual skill.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* Is "show, don't tell" different from traditional instruction?
* When engaging in your teaching experience, in what ways were your
  students contructing, hypothesizing, exploting, experimenting,
  evaluating, and drawing conclusions?
* How did you ensure that the students were learning?

2. LOGO: A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR CHILDREN
--------------------------------------------
</a>

Logo enables children to “use computers to manipulate things more
familiar than the then-prevalent numbers and equations.”
&mdash;F. Martin

Goal
----

Logo is the first computer programming language designed for
children. Papert and his collaborators at BBN aimed to create a
program language with a “low floor” and a “high ceiling.” In other
words, a language that would make it easy for a novice programmer—such
as a child—to get started writing programs, but that also had the
power and the “sky is the limit” capability to be useful to an
experienced programmer. The goal of this class is to introduce the
students to Logo programming and set them on the path to reaching
towards the high ceiling of programming.

Tools
-----

The Turtle Blocks programming language will be used as a
representative and readily available Logo platform.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* What are the practical limitations to a block-based programming
  language such as Turtle Blocks?
* How do we assess the learning?
* What has changed in the 45 years since Papert and Solomon published
  "20 things to do with a computer"?

<a name="ROBOTICS">
3. LOGO ROBOTICS
----------------
</a>

Goal
----

In its early days, Logo was used to control a simple robot, known as
the “Turtleturtle”. The original Logo turtle, invented by Paul
Wexelblat at BBN, was known as Irving. He had touch sensors and could
move forward and backward, rotate, and ring his bell. Children would
type commands such as FORWARD 50 to make Irving go forward 50 steps,
or RIGHT 90 to make him turn right ninety degrees. Irving carried a
pen, so children could make drawings on a piece of paper. By using
Irving, children engaged in basic problem solving, with Irving giving
immediate, non­written feedback so that problems (bugs) could be
spotted, all while having fun. Later versions had a turtle­shaped
on­screen cursor, which could be given instructions for movement and
could produce vector graphics when given instructions to draw.

In this class, students will get hands-on experience with a
programmable robot and use it to develop a learning experience.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* How would you enhance the capabilities of Irving were you to build a
  Logo robot today?

4. THE SUGAR DESKTOP
--------------------
</a>

“We're too concentrated on having our children learn the answers. I
would teach them how to ask questions&mdash;because that's how you
learn.” &mdash;David McCullough

Goal
----

Sugar is the software orginially developed for the One Laptop per
Child project. The goal behind Sugar was (and is) to replace
interaction between children and rigidly defined electronic
educational materials with a set of tools that encourage creativity
and enable even very young children to program and modify those tools.

The goal of this class is to introduce the Sugar Learning Platform and
its collection of activities for exploration, construction,
collaboration, and reflection.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* How does Sugar go "beyond black boxes"?
* Why is it (or isn't it) important that Sugar is Free/Libre Software?
* Does it matter that learners and teachers contribute code to Sugar?
* How does Sugar stike a balance between control and autonomy?

*Imagine and realize* &mdash;J. Maeda<br>*Critique and reflect* &mdash;W. Bender

Questions to Consider
---------------------
* How do Contructionist principles manifest themselves in your project?
* How can you characterize the learning in your project?
* How can you measure the learning in your project?
* To what extent is your project an incremental change vs a disruption?
* How will your project mesh with existing educational initiatives?
* How does your project create value?
