PROGRAMMING MUSIC
=================

This course covers the technical aspects of digital music for use in
practical applications. Topics include the software libraries for the
production of music and their use in applications and
instrumentation. Students will become acquainted with digital music
while engaged in designing their own instruments, utilizing software
and sensor technology.

Walter Bender (walter@miamicollegeofdesign.com)

Objective
---------

The objective of this course is to give students sufficient
scaffolding in the physics of sound, acoustics, psychoacoustics, music
theory, and analog and digital audio processing such that they can
credibly and deliberately incorporate music into the designs.

Approach
--------

To aid students in their pursuit, the course consists of hands on
exploration of questions that point to the critical scientific and
technological challenges of sound and music and hands on attempt to
pursue personal exploration of a theory and model for music as a tool
for communication.

Course Organization
-------------------

There will be two weekly meetings: (1) a discussion and experiment;
and (2) a recitation for in-depth review of the material. Generally
each class will begin with discussion of research other people have
done on the same topic as last week's exploration topic. This
discussion may include visits by some of the researchers or by authors
who have written on the subject. The intent is to encourage students
to explore a subject before reading about it. This approach tends to
avoid biasing interpretations of what might be going on and provides
students with their own base of experience to which they can relate
when reading research on the topic of interest. The second class
activity will be an exploration of this week's class goal.

Requirements
------------

Weekly programming assignments and reading, as well as an individual
or group term project. Classes will consist of a weekly group
experiment, brief lecture, and discussion. There will be occasional
guest lectures by leading digital music researchers.

Course Outline
--------------

1. [Music Blocks](#MUSICBLOCKS)
2. [CSound](#CSOUND)
3. [Physics of Sound](#PHYSICS)
4. [Mind and Music](#MINDMUSIC)
5. [Music Instrumentation](#INSTRUMENTATION)
6. [Project reviews](#PROJECTS)

Grading
-------
50% of your grade is based on class participation in the experiential
exploration of questions pointing to critical challenges.

25% of your grade will be for a project that might add insight to an
effective color model with stated objectives. The intent is to offer
you the opportunity to pursue something personally meaningful.

25% of your grade is dependent upon weekly problems.

"Csound is a sound and music computing system which was originally
developed by Barry Vercoe in 1985 at MIT Media Lab. Since the 90s, it
has been developed by a group of core developers. A wider community of
volunteers contribute examples, documentation, articles, and takes
part in the Csound development with bug reports, feature requests and
discussions with the core development team.

"Although Csound has a strong tradition as a tool for composing
electro-acoustic pieces, it is used by composers and musicians for any
kind of music that can be made with the help of the computer. Csound
has tradtionally being used in a non-interactive score driven context,
but nowadays it is mostly used in in a real-time context. Csound can
run on a host of different platforms incuding all major operating
systems as well as Android and iOS. Csound can also be called through
other programming languages such as Python, Lua, C/C++, Java, etc."

3. THE PHYSICS OF SOUND
-----------------------
</a>

Goal
----

Sound is produced from vibrations in air that we can hear. The goal of
this class is to explore different physical sources of vibrations and
how they impact audio perception. We will explore pitch perception as
it relates to frequency, amplitude as it relates to sound intensity,
and the limits of the human ear. We will also explore different
mechanisms for creating resonance and standing waves as they relate to
music and musical instruments.
