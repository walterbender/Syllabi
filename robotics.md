ROBOTS AND MECHATRONICS 
=======================

Course Description
------------------

This course presents concepts, principles, and algorithms for sensing
and computation related to the physical world. Upon completion of this
course, students will have developed skills to design a small-scale
yet complex robot capable of real-time interaction with the natural
world.

Instructor
----------

(TBD)

Course Objectives
-----------------

* Achieve a general understanding of robotics and their role in creative
  thinking;
* Learn how to use mechatronics in unconventional ways to solve
  challenging tasks;
* Develop team-working and communication skills;
* Develop critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.

Course Structure
----------------

This is a 6-week, project-based course. Students will work as a team
on a group project of their own chosing and weekly challenges. The
weekly challenges are designed to introduce specific skills that may
be incorporated into the group project.

Grading
-------

* Participation (25%, valued through weekly attendance and team evaluation)
* Weekly Projects (25%, 5 projects at 5% each)
* Group Project (50%)

Materials
---------

RoDi (RedBot or Zumo 32u4 or an arduino-based platform), 1 per team
(Specific Robot TBD)
Journal
Laptop

Group Project
-------------

The goal of the group project is to incorporate robotics and
mechatronics into a project of personal interest. How can robotics
help you address an authentic problem?

<a name="INTRODUCTION">
1. PROGRAMMING ROBOTS
---------------------
</a>

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to master the basics of programming a
robot. Students will also form teams that will work on a group
project.

Equipment
---------

* Programmable robot with motors and a light sensor

Challenge
---------

Program a robot to follow a line using a light sensor.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* Does the robot do the exact same thing every time it tries to
  accomplish the task?
* Is your solution robust to slight changes to the path?
* What changes would cause your solution to fail?
* Is it possible to follow a line without using any sensors?


<a name="SENSORS">
2. USING SENSORS
----------------
</a>

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to familiarize the student with a variety of
different sensor types, how to calibrate a sensor, and how to
incorporate a sensor into an interactive experience.

Group-project ideas will also be shared and critiqued.

Equipment
---------

* Programmable robot with motors and sensors

Challenge
---------

Program a robot to interact with a user in a responsive way, e.g.,
following the user, shying away from the user, mirroring the user,
etc.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* Why factors determined your choice of sensor?
* Did the calibration drift over time?
* If so, how did detect and/or compensate for the drift?
* In building a responsive robot, do you think it is possible to
  emulate human affect?

<a name="CUSTOMSENSOR">
35. Custom sensors
-----------------
</a>

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to devel more deeply into sensor
design. Students will become familiar with the range of sensors
available, how to chose the appropriate sensor for the task at hand,
and how to incorporate the sensor into their project.

Equipment
---------

* Programmable robot
* A variety of sensors from which to choose.

Challenge
---------

Design an extension to your robot that allows it to measure the
distance it travels as it navigates a labyrinth.

Questions to Consider
---------------------


<a name="ACTUATORS">
4. Actuators
------------
</a>

Goal
----

The goal of this class is to learn how to integrate an actuator to a
robot, transforming an input signal into some form of motion. Students
will familiarize themselves with different mechanical systems and the
use of control signals.

Equipment
---------

* Programmable robot with motors and a solenoid 

Challenge
---------

Add a retractable pen to the robot so that it can draw.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* What are five different ways one could solve the stated challenge?
* What are the criteria for determining which solution to chose?
* What are the typical performance metrics for actuators?
* How would you decide between hydraulic, pneumatic, magnetic,
  thermal, electrical, or mechanical actuators in a real-world design?
