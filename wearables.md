Objective
---------

This course will explore wearables, a subset of design in which the
This includes “smart watches” that monitor biometrics, exoskeletons
that provide enhanced physical capabilities, to more mundane
technologies, such as hearing aides and eye glasses. These devices
have a wide range of applications, from making a fashion statement to
impacting health and well being to enhancing inter-device and
inter-personnel communication. Student in the course will consider the
design challenges specific to wearable technologies, including such
issues as parasitic power, weight, comfort, durability, etc.

Approach
--------

Students will be introduced to the interdisciplinary technique of
wearable design and be provided with real-world experiences applying
this technique through individual and team work. The course focuses on
the design factors unique to wearables while working on a project of
their own choosing.

By the end of the course, students will:
* have a solid understanding of wearable design and technology;
* be able to determine when a wearable-technology solution is an
  appropriate design choice;
* be cognizant of the various design trade-offs that are specific to
  wearables.

Course Organization
-------------------

Students will progress through the course through two phases: liquid
(discovery and innovation) and solid (design, consolidation, and
delivery).

During the liquid phase, Weeks 1 through 6, the bi-weekly meetings
will be organized in a dynamic interchange between experimentation,
discussion and presentation of the conceptual framework through the
exploration of concrete cases and examples.

During the solid phase, Weeks 8 through 15, there will be twice-weekly
meetings with the design faculty to move through a design pipeline,
taking the ideas developed in the liquid phase into a design
recommendation for production.

In the Discovery Step, students will further develop the thumbnail
sketches from Week 3 as they develop their product strategy. They will
also do an ecosystem analysis, so as to understand the context into
which their product will be situated.

Questions to Consider
---------------------

* Where does this product sit within its market or within a connected
ecosystem of products?

<a name="WEEK5">
5. ABSTRACT STEP
----------------
</a>

Students will take two of the sketches from Week 4 and further develop
them, while remaining broad. Specify design criteria will be
identified and incorporating into strategies for design solutions.

Questions to Consider
